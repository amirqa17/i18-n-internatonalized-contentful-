# Next.js Dynamic Contentful Blog with full i18n Internatinalization Integration

ðŸš€This project uses Contentful for Blog, and i18n to switch between languages and conditionally load relative blog post's fields, so that blog feed is translated as well.

## Issues I'm aware of and upcoming fixes, probably by the end of January
 I'm aware of some minor issues since I priorized functionality on this project and current version is like a lowkey MVP.
 This project will be updated weekly and when I find time and I plan on redoing layout and making some changes that include: 
- **Semantic tags/Removing nesting divs/Overall review of the structure
- **Multiple designs/layouts for blogposts/cards to choose from
- **Divide some elements into multiple components
- **There are also some performance issues that can be fixed, but again, I plan to add it when I have time. 
## Features

- **Multilingual Support**: Switch between languages seamlessly.
- **Contentful Integration**: Manage blog content effortlessly.
- **Dynamic Content**: Conditionally render fields based on language.
- **Responsive Design**: Enjoy a responsive blog on various devices.

## New features and fixes coming soon
